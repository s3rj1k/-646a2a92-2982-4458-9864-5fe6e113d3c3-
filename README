Create a new Go application that does the following:
- Runs as a daemon on the command line
- Structure the program so that it can be expanded for more routes and become a larger application, even though we're only going to put two routes in it for this test.
- Uses MongoDB as a database with an accounts collection
- Exposes port 80 and provides an HTTP REST interface
- Provides a /create_account route that takes an HTTP POST with JSON body that contains an email address and password and creates a document in the accounts collection of the DB with the email and password
- Ensure the password is stored securely in the database
- Provides an /authenticate route that takes an HTTP POST with a JSON body that contains an email address and password and authenticates it vs a stored account.  Returns an HTTP 200 if successful or an HTTP 401 if not successful.
- Should handle errors and return 400's
- Should log nicely to the console
- Should have tests
